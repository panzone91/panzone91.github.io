# **[panz-crypto](https://github.com/afiuorio/panz-crypto)**

pcrypto is a collection of cryptographic algorithms and attacks I've made during my cryptographic studies.

**This library isn't secure nor written by an expert cryptographer so you shouldn't use it in any context that a cryptographic implementation is required**. I've released it for helping students with a comprehensible and modular implementation of some algorithms and attacks.

The library includes:

* AES 128 implementation
* Square attack to a 5-round AES
* RSA attack based on Fermat factoritation
* Blum-Micali
