    <p align="justify">I'm a computer scientist and a software developer. My main areas of interest are software security, reverse engineering,
    programming languages development, cryptography and system administration but I'm an "all around" computer scientist and developer. I like the concept of solving
    problems in an efficient way and I'm quite interested in "low-level development":
    computers are complex machines and I want to handle the "complex" part for making them easier to use.</p>
